        "- **Особенности кастомной реализации:** Кастомный подход продемонстрировал высокую полноту (Recall = 1.0), но при этом более низкую точность (Precision), что может свидетельствовать о переобобщении или завышенной чувствительности модели.\n",
        "- **Сравнение по mAP:** Несмотря на снижение точности, значения mAP (в частности, mAP@0.5) для кастомной оценки находятся на уровне, сопоставимом с YOLOv8, что подчёркивает потенциал данного подхода при дальнейшем развитии.\n",
